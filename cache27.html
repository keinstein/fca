<font color="#000000"><p>Knowledge engineering (KE) consists in building, maintaining and developing knowledge-based systems. It has a great deal in common with software engineering, and is related to many computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, data mining, expert systems, decision support systems, user modelling, web technologies, computational linguistics and geographic information systems.</p> 

<p>Knowledge engineering is also related to mathematical logic, as well as strongly involved in cognitive science and socio-cogintive engineering where the knowledge is produced by socio-cognitive aggregates (mainly humans) and is structured according to our understanding of how human reasoning and logic works.</p> 

<p>Various activities of KE specific for the development of a knowledge-based system: Assessment of the problem; Development of a knowledge-based system shell/structure; Implementation of the structured knowledge into knowledge-bases; Acquisition and structuring of the related information, knowledge and specific preferences; Testing and validation of the inserted knowledge; Integration and maintenance of the system; Revision and evaluation of the system.</p>

<p>Being still more art than engineering, KE is not as neat as the above list in practice. The phases overlap, the process might be iterative, and many challenges could appear. Recently, emerges meta-knowledge engineering as a new formal systemic approach to the development of an unified knowledge and intelligence theory.</p>

<p>Conceptual knowledge engineering aims to put more emphasis on the interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that enable them to function togetherduring the KE process. One major goal here is to focus the KE process onto the design of conceptual models, methods and structures. Our objective in this workshop is to provide information on recent advances on KE using conceptual similarity-based measures, concept lattices, conceptual graphs, rough sets, description logics, concept mapping, ontologies and more, in both theoretical and applicational aspects of KE.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">The ultimate aim of this workshop is to provide state-of-the-art information to academics, researchers, and industry practitioners whom are involved or interested in both theoretical and applicational aspects of conceptual knowledge engineering. Prospective authors are invited to submit original and previously unpublished research showing related to the following topics:</font>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual structures,</li>
<li>Relationship of FCA with other methods of data analysis (clustering,
association rules, classification, etc.),</li>
<li>Data for Formal Concept Analysis (object-attribute data, pre-processing of data, conceptual scaling, fuzzy attributes, etc.),</li>
<li>Applications of FCA on semantic web and ontologies.</li>
</ul>
