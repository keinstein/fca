<h2>Workshop for FCA Tools and Applications (at 
<a href="http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/icfca13">ICFCA'2013</a>)</h2>

Current FCA conferences usually focus on research papers, not on
applications or tools. Therefore the "Workshop for FCA Tools and
Applications" aims to provide a forum for FCA users and developers
of FCA software to present their applications or short tutorials
on how to use their software. The focus is on FCA-tools, tools
or plugins that can be used in combination with FCA software, or closely
related technology.
Presentations will last 30 minutes; tutorials will last 1 hour.
For most of the tutorials, the workshop participants will be able to install
and run the software on their laptops. 
(Although some tools only run on some operating systems.) A small number
of laptops will be available for borrowing for participants who did not
bring their own laptop or who are using a different operating system.

<h3>Abstracts of the Tutorials/Presentations</h3>

<p><b>Temporal Concept Analysis in SIENA</b><br>
<a name="Wolff">Karl Erich Wolff</a><br>
(Ernst Schröder Center for Conceptual Knowledge Processing, Darmstadt)<p>

The tutorial will enable users in understanding their temporal data by
representing these data first in CERNATO, scaling the data and
generating suitable views which can be visualized in the Temporal
Concept Analysis tool in SIENA (a part of TOSCANAJ) such that life
tracks ("trajectories") of several objects can be studied simultaneously
in "transition diagrams". The more general possibility of representing
moving distributed objects (e.g. a high pressure zone) is explained by
examples showing also the applicability of this method for representing
temporal fuzzy data.


<p><b>Data analysis with the Formal Concept Analysis Research Toolbox (FCART)</b><br>
<a name="Neznanov">Alexey Neznanov and Dmitry Ilvovsky</a><br>
(School of Applied Mathematics and Information Sciences, NRU HSE, Russia)<p>


We consider a full research cycle of data analysis using FCA-based
techniques and methods. We go through this cycle with a new software called Formal
Concept Analysis Research Toolbox (FCART). The 
demonstration includes the following stages:<br>
 1) accessing an external data source and loading data;<br>
 2) preprocessing data and building multi-valued context;<br>
 3) dynamical scaling of multivalued context;<br>
 4) working with binary context;<br>
 4.1) constructing lattice and visualizing line diagram;<br>
 4.2) building sublattices;<br>
 4.3) filtering source lattice and searching for formal concepts;<br>
 4.4) finding association rules and other related artifacts;<br>
 4.5) saving lattice as graph or image;<br>
 5) building reports.<br>

<p><b>Towards (re)construction of the theory of linguistic oppositions within the
framework of Interactive Linguistics</b><br>
<a name="Wlodarczyk">André Wlodarczyk</a><br>
(Paris, Sorbonne)<p>
1. Linguistic typology practice<br>
The most characteristic difference between formal and typological linguistics is
perhaps the fact that while the former starts with the thesis that "natural
languages are like formal ones", the latter claim that "natural languages are
ambiguous". Therefore, formal linguistics is deductive while typological linguistics
is inductive.
<p>
2. Need for modelling with KDD methodology using the "Semana" implementation of FCA.<br>
Nevertheless, a few examples suffice to understand that efforts of some typologists
to use formal(ised) meta-languages in order to explain their observations of natural
language phenomena fail because of the lack of means to verify models they pursue.
<p>
I will try to show some of our results of research aiming at adapting some aspects
of FCA.  However, these results are rather poor because either they are still in
research-and-development phase or focus only on the rediscovered by us but well
known mathematical concepts such as Real and Ideal. Indeed, our concern is not only
application of FCA to linguistic objects but also adaptation of FCA algorithms to
what we feel could enable us to better explain natural language phenomena.
<p>
In the same spirit, we implemented an algorithm of approximating formal concepts.
However, besides our purely intellectual satisfaction and hypothetical usefulness
for machine 'understanding' of natural language expressions, we did not find any
practical application of the Rough FCA to linguistics, as yet.
<p>
The above problems will be mentioned showing examples of interaction with Semana,
because I really seek how to use properly the FCA technology in order to discover
reliable knowledge about the natural language 'systems'.
<p>
3. FCA view on natural language<br>
Due to the ambiguous nature of linguistic signs, typologists need to describe
linguistic units in contexts of their use. Therefore, they have to aim at defining
usages of units instead of the units themselves. The question is what represent
Formal Concepts in such specific Contexts. To answer this question, it is especially
important to study the relationships (oppositions) between grammatical units because
of their abstract orthogonality.

<p><b>In Search for Meaning, Values, Aims, Measures by the GABEK Methodology</b><br>
<a name="Zelger">Josef Zelger<br>
(Univ.-Prof. i. R., Department of Philosophy, University of Innsbruck)</a><p>

<a href="http://www.gabek.com/material/">GABEK</a> &reg;
(Ganzheitliche Bewältigung von Komplexität - Holistic Coping with Complexity) 
is a qualitative method for opinion research, knowledge processing, and organization 
development.
It allows verbal data to be represented as conceptual nets, where lexical concepts 
are the nodes and statements the edges. Conceptual nets can be reduced in complexity 
and can be used for the selection of core topics as well for concept analysis and 
ontology generation.
In a second step through coding of evaluations expressed in the texts by the 
respondents, systems of values and goals are analyzed in an intersubjective and 
reconstructable way. 
In the third step of analysis causal assumptions of the respondents are coded and 
displayed graphically. New fields and potentials of action are thus opened up.
Finally by construction of a "Gestalten-tree" the verbal data are organized in a 
logical and hierarchical order. It provides a structured overview and furthers 
holistic understanding.

<p><b>Exploratory Programming for Formal Concept Analysis – An Introduction
to conexp-clj</b><br>
<a name="Borchmann">Daniel Borchmann</a><br>
(TH Dresden)<p>

We give a gentle introduction to 
<a href="http://github.com/exot/conexp-clj">conexp-clj</a>, a general purpose tool
  for formal concept analysis.  To this end, we shall introduce basic
  notions and design principles of the program and its underlying
  programming language, Clojure, as well as discuss examples, both
  simple and complex, that can be handled by the conexp-clj.
