<h2>FCA software interoperability</h2>

The FCA community has produced a fair amount of 
<a href="fcasoftware.html">FCA software</a>, but more work needs to be done
with respect to improving the interoperability among FCA tools and between
FCA tools and other tools for data storage and exploration (spreadsheets,
databases, mathematical and statistical tools, etc). 

<p>

<h4>FCA Software Interoperability Workshop
at the CLA 2010 Conference</h4>

"This Workshop will provide a discussion forum for researchers and developers 
who are interested in the integration of FCA and Computer Algebra System software, 
such as Sage and Matlab, or other mainstream tools (database, spreadsheet, ERP ...).

The purpose is to determine what the FCA community can do to improve the 
interoperability of FCA tools with other existing tools in order to make 
it easier to use FCA with such tools."

<h4>Wiki</h4>

We have a Wiki for discussion at <a href="https://github.com/exot/conexp-clj/wiki">
this address</a>. (A copy of content from a previous wiki about FCA file formats
is <a href="fcafileformats.html">here</a>.)
