Their central focus   is the formal representation and analysis of conceptual knowledge with applications   to artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and related areas of   computer science.</p><p> Historically, a group of researchers working on the theory and applications   of Conceptual Graphs founded the ICCS. Over the years, they have broadened the   scope to include a wider range of theories, among them Formal Concept Analysis,   Description Logics, Situation Theory, Discourse Representation Theory,   and related techniques. </p><p>Papers for ICCS 2003 are invited on the following topics: conceptual structures   (theory, applications, and experience with case studies); their interplay with language,    semantics and pragmatics; formal methods for concept analysis and contextual logic,    modeling, representation, and visualization of concepts; conceptual knowledge acquisition;    and the theory and applications of formal ontologies. Comparisons of methods and representations  on the basis of reasoning ability, expressiveness, ease of use, and computational   performance are welcome.   Integration of methodologies, user interfaces, knowledge use, reuse, and   integration are all of high interest at ICCS 2003. </p><p>Papers on the ICCS 2003 theme of "Knowledge Creation and Communication" are  particularly encouraged.   ICCS 2003 will focus on the interplay between meaning and formalization of  conceptual structures, and on the relation  between data, information, and knowledge. Of special interest is the question to  which extent formal representations of conceptual structures can support human  communication and knowledge creation.   Papers which discuss such research or applications in the area of bringing together   Formal Concept Analysis and Contextual Logic, Conceptual Graphs, formal ontologies  within the Semantic Web or other areas are strongly encouraged,   as well as papers linking conceptual structures to other fields or applications.</p><p>Authors are invited to submit papers describing both theoretical and practical   research. Papers accepted or under review by other conferences or journals are   not acceptable as submissions to ICCS. The language of the conference will be English.</p><p><b>Authors' Information</b> </p><p>Papers are limited to 14 pages in Springer's format. We strongly recommend the  use of LaTeX2e for the final version. For more details see   <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">   http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>.<br>  Position papers (2 pages) are also welcome.<p>     For all papers, a one page abstract in PostScript or PDF format must be received by   Tuesday January 7, 2003. Abstracts should clearly state the purpose, results and   conclusions of the work to be described in the final paper. The electronic submission   of the full paper in Postscript or PDF format must be received on   or before Thursday, January 9, 2003. </p><p>  Submit your abstract and your paper via email to Aldo de Moor (ademoor@uvt.nl)  with ICCS2003   in the subject line. Please include your name and your full address. In case you have problems  with electronic submission, contact Bernhard Ganter as early as possible. An address is given below.</p><p>   Final acceptance will be based on the full-length paper, which if accepted, must be   presented at the conference. Papers accepted for publication will appear in the   Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence Series by Springer-Verlag.  Position papers and papers which are not included in the LNAI volume, but are of sufficient quality   and interest to the community, will be published in supplementary proceedings.   A precondition for publication (for all papers) is that the final version is in full compliance  with Springer's format.</p><p><b>Call for Workshop Proposals</b></p><p>Workshop proposals for ICCS 2003 are invited on any of the areas of interest to the   Conceptual Structures community, including specialized sub-areas. Previous workshops have   included CG tools, PORT Pragmatic Web and Concept lattice-based Knowledge Discovery.   The deadline for submission of workshop proposals to the Program Chairs is February 1, 2003.</p><p><b>Conference Chairs and Editorial Board</b> </p><p>General Chair:  Bernhard Ganter (TU Dresden, Germany)</p><p>Program Chairs: Aldo de Moor (Tilburg University, The Netherlands),                    Wilfried Lex (TU Clausthal, Germany)</p><p>Editorial Board:</p><p>Galia Angelova (Bulgaria) <br>                                                                Michel Chein (France) <br>                                                                Dan Corbett (Australia) <br>                                                                 Harry Delugach (USA) <br>                                                              Peter Eklund (Australia) <br>                                                                Mary Keeler (USA)<br>Sergei Kuznetsov (Russia) <br>                                                            Lotfi Lakhal (France) <br>                                                                Guy Mineau (Canada) <br>                                                                  Bernard Moulin (Canada) <br>                                                              Marie-Laure Mugnier (France) <br>                                                         Heather Pfeiffer (USA) <br>                                                            Uta Priss (UK) <br>                                                                   John Sowa (USA)  <br>                                                                  Gerd Stumme (Germany) <br>                                                                 Bill Tepfenhart (USA) <br>                                                             Rudolf Wille (Germany) <br>                                                                </p><p><b>Further Information</b></p><p>This call for papers and the latest information regarding the conference can   be found on the World Wide Web at: <a href="http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~iccs/">http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~iccs/  </a></p><p> Bernhard Ganter<br> Institut f&uuml;r Algebra<br> TU Dresden<br> D-01062 Dresden<br> Germany<br> <br>    <a href="mailto:ganter@math.tu-dresden.de"> &lt;ganter@math.tu-dresden.de&gt;</a><br>    Phone: +49-351-463-35063<br> Fax: +49-351-463-34235<br><h2 align="center">&nbsp;</h2><h2 align="center">&nbsp;</h2><h2 align="center">&nbsp;</h2></body></html>
